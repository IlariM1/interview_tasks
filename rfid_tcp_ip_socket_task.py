Test Scenario: Testing Embedded RFID Reader Software

Description:
You are testing embedded software for an RFID reader.
The software sends RFID data over TCP/IP to a server. Write a Python script to:

    Simulate an RFID reader by sending JSON data over TCP/IP.

    Validate that the server receives the data correctly.

    Log progress.

Steps:

    Create a TCP/IP client in Python to send JSON data.

    Simulate sending multiple RFID entries.

    Validate the serverâ€™s response.


Expected Output:

    Successful data transmission and server response.
    Proper error handling for network issues.
